This the subdirectories of this directory contains compiled shared
libraries for different systems.

DecodeIR is version 2.45.

Linux users are strongly encouraged to use librxtxSerial.so supplied
by their Linux distribution, if possible -- it (should) manage file
locking etc. compatible with the rest of the distro.

Mac users: note that the default file extension for JNI libraries
changed lately (by OS X 10.9?) from .jnilib to .dylib.
