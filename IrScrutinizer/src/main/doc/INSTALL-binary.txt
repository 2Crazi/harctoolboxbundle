This is the generic binary distribution of IrScrutinizer. It runs on
Linux, Windows, Macs, and probably on other similar systems as well.

Users of Fedora Linux should probably use the Fedora package instead,
available RSN. Installation will be, as root,

yum install irscrutinizer

Users of other Linux-es should preferably exert pressure on their
distributor to port the Fedora packages ;-). Windows users probably
prefers the Windows setup.exe version.

To install, unpack in an empty directory of your choice, suggested is
/usr/local/irscrutinizer. Inspect the wrapper irscrutinizer.sh, and
make changes if necessary.

It is recommended to make links from a directory in the path to the
wrapper script, e.g.

ln -s /usr/local/irscrutinizer/irscrutinizer.sh /usr/local/bin/irscrutinizer
ln -s /usr/local/irscrutinizer/irscrutinizer.sh /usr/local/bin/irpmaster

If your system supports the RXTX, you should preferably use that. See
the comments in the wrapper irscrutinizer.sh.

The JNI library libDecodeIR.so/DecodeIR.dll is contained in the
distribution and should be found without problems.

The desktop file irscrutinizer.desktop should, if desired, be
installed in /usr/local/share/applications alternatively ~/Desktop.
